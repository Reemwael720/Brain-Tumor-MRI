# Brain Tumor MRI Classification

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify MRI brain scans as either containing a tumor or being tumor-free. Leveraging deep learning techniques, this model provides an effective tool for aiding medical professionals in the early detection of brain tumors.

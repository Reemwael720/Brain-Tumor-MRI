# Brain Tumor MRI Classification

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify MRI brain scans as either containing a tumor or being tumor-free. Leveraging deep learning techniques, this model provides an effective tool for aiding medical professionals in the early detection of brain tumors.

## Dataset
The model is trained using the [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset) from Kaggle. This dataset consists of MRI images categorized into:
- Tumor
- No Tumor
  
## Training
